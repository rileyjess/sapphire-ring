# Task Board

## Description
This website is a task board where new project tasks can be added and reorganized to measure the progress of a project. 

Acceptance Criteria:
- When the user opens the task board, the list of project tasks is displayed in columns representing the task progress state (Not Yet Started, In Progress, Completed)
- When the user views the task board for the project, each task is color coded to indicate whether it is nearing the deadline (yellow) or is overdue (red)
- When the user clicks on the button to define a new task, they can enter the title, description and deadline date for the new task into a modal dialog
- When the user clicks the save button for that task, the properties for that task are saved in localStorage
- When they drag a task to a different progress column, the task's progress state is updated accordingly and will stay in the new column after refreshing
- When the delete button is clicked for a task, the task is removed from the task board and will not be added back after refreshing
- When the page is refreshed, the saved tasks persist
